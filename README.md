# Coffee Partner Lottery
A small project from Covid-19 times, for generating random pairings of people who can have a virtual chat and coffee together. The Python script in this repo takes care of the generation, my whole process for the lottery is as follows: 

1. Let interested people sign up. I use MS Forms for the Coffee Partner Lottery at UU's Department of Information and Computing Sciences (template available [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=oFgn10akD06gqkv5WkoQ51EXCAYj7jZCpuwTHAmfcRhUQk1ZOEtTTDJBQVozU0tVN0ZSNlFGWDEwNC4u&sharetoken=NNfcIwyZoQl07ZdXpHkZ)), but Google Forms or another similar tool will also do. You can download the responses and save them as a CSV file (e.g. "Coffee Partner Lottery participants.csv"), which is the input for the Python script.  
2. Run the Python script to generate a set of pairs. It will store all pairs ever generated in another CSV file (all_pairs.csv), to keep track of already generated pairs and thus making sure that new people meet each time. The new set of pairs is written to a separate CSV file (new_pairs.csv). 
3. Use Thunderbird's MailMerge plugin to automatically generate e-mails with the information from new_pairs.csv, to inform people that they have been paired. I haven't tried, but probably MS Outlook and other e-mail clients have similar functionality. Alternatively, you can just copy the list of pairs from the program output and send them to a Teams chat, group mailing list, or similar.
